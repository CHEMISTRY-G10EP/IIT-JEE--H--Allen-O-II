  "Step 2: For option (B), analyze whether a zero-order reaction must be complex.",
  "A zero-order reaction is one where the rate is independent of the concentration of reactants.",
  "Many zero-order reactions are complex, such as heterogeneous catalytic reactions where the catalyst surface is saturated.",
  "However, some simple reactions can show pseudo-zero-order behavior when one reactant is in large excess and its concentration remains effectively constant.",

  "Molecularity is defined as the number of molecules involved in an elementary reaction step.",
  "It applies to all elementary steps, not only to the Rate Determining Step (RDS).",

  "Hence, statement (C) is incorrect because molecularity is not limited to only the RDS.",
  
  "Step 4: For option (D), analyze the effect of temperature on the rate constant k.",
  "The Arrhenius equation $k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$ shows that k depends on temperature.",
  "As temperature increases, more molecules have energy greater than the activation energy $E_a$, leading to an increased rate constant.",

  "Step 1: For option (A), analyze the relationship between stoichiometry and order in elementary reactions.",

  "The general rate law is: $\\text{Rate} = k [\\text{Reactant}]^0$.",
  "Since any non-zero concentration raised to the power of zero is 1, this simplifies to $\\text{Rate} = k$.",

  "In a zero-order reaction, the rate does not depend on the concentration of reactants.",
  "Instead, factors like catalyst surface area (in catalytic reactions), light intensity (in photochemical reactions), or temperature are responsible for controlling the reaction rate.",

  ],
  "correct": ["A", "B", "C"],
  "solution": "(A) False: Not every reaction has a well-defined overall order, especially in complex or chain reactions where multiple steps are involved.<br><br>(B) False: Rate constants have different dimensions depending on the order of the reaction. For example, a first-order reaction has units of \\(s^{-1}\\), while a second-order reaction has units of \\(L\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}\\).<br><br>(C) False: Some intermediates or species not listed as reactants or products can appear in the rate law, particularly in multi-step mechanisms.<br><br>(D) True: The rate constant is always positive because it represents the frequency factor and the exponential dependence on activation energy, both of which are inherently non-negative.<br><br>Conclusion: Statements (A), (B), and (C) are false.",
 "solution_steps": [
    "Step 1: Analyze Statement (A).",
    "Statement: Every reaction has a defined overall order.",
    "Explanation: While many reactions have a defined order (0, 1, 2, etc.), for complex reactions or when partial orders are negative, the overall order may not be clearly defined.",
    "Example: If a partial order is negative, the sum of exponents may not represent a meaningful overall order.",
    "Conclusion: Statement (A) is Incorrect.",

    "Step 2: Analyze Statement (B).",
    "Statement: All rate constants have the same dimension.",
    "Explanation: The units of the rate constant $k$ depend on the overall order of the reaction.",
    "For zero-order: $[k] = \\text{mol L}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$",
    "For first-order: $[k] = \\text{s}^{-1}$",

    "Statement: Every species in the rate law must be a reactant or product.",
    "Explanation: This is not always true. Catalysts or intermediates, which do not appear in the overall balanced equation, can appear in the rate law.",
    "Example: A catalyst concentration may appear in $r = k[\\text{A}][\\text{catalyst}]$ even though the catalyst is not consumed.",
    "Conclusion: Statement (C) is Incorrect.",

    "Step 4: Analyze Statement (D).",
    "Statement: Rate constant is never negative.",
    "Explanation: The rate constant $k$ is always positive because the rate of reaction must be a positive quantity (rate = decrease in [reactant] or increase in [product] per unit time).",
